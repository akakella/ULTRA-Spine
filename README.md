# ULTRA-Spine

MATLAB code for modeling of spine dynamics and control.

ULTRA Spine 2 contains the two-link model with waypoint-based MPC.

ULTRA Spine 3 contains the dynamics for a three-link model.

ULTRA Spine 4 - Trajectory Tracking contains the four-link model with trajectory-tracking MPC.

ULTRA Spine 4 - SQP contains the four-link model with trajectory-tracking MPC and trajectory optimization routine using SQP.

This branch, 4 Input Model, will reduce the number of inputs to only the 4 that are on the actual ULTRA Spine robot. These four will be the vertical cable sets, actuated at different ratios to each other.
